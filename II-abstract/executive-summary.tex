\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Executive Summary}

This work aims at assessing the security posture of the new Dutch centralized system for vote counting. In this report, the core services, information, and processes are analyzed. Also, the impacts and likelihoods of the possible incidents tied to these processes are estimated. A great number of high-rating threats have been found. 

Furthermore, an acceptable level of risk is defined to produce a set of security controls to apply before and after an incident.

After the application of these security measures, no severe-rating threats have remained.
